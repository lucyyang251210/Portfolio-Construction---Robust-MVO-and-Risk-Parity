    % An example of an MVO implementation is given below. You can use this
    % version of MVO if you like, but feel free to modify this code as much
    % as you need to. You can also change the inputs and outputs to suit
    % your needs. 
    
    % You may use quadprog, Gurobi, or any other optimizer you are familiar
    % with. Just be sure to include comments in your code.
